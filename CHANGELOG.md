# Changelog

All notable changes to the PSA SimpleMLP project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2024-12-19

### Added

#### New Analysis Tools
- **`analyze_dataset.py`**: Comprehensive MNIST dataset analysis tool
  - Uses exact same methodology as PSA SimpleMLP training code
  - Provides class distribution statistics for all dataset splits
  - Calculates ZeroR baselines for each split (11.24% train, 11.35% test, 11.28% split-train, 11.02% validation)
  - Available as `poetry run analyze-dataset` command
  - Returns structured `MNISTAnalysis` object for programmatic access

- **`scripts/regime_classifier.py`**: Rule-based training regime classification system
  - Data-driven classification using actual trial results
  - Four distinct training regimes: Untrainable, Chaotic Optimization, Beneficial Regularization, Optimally Sized
  - Robust classification rules with 100% coverage (no "unknown" cases)
  - Applies 0.5% minimum standard deviation cap to prevent overly strict conditions
  - Uses 11.35% threshold corresponding to ZeroR baseline from test set

#### Enhanced Visualizations
- **Sixth Heatmap**: "Regimes" visualization added to `make_figure_heatmaps.py`
  - Uses regime classifier for data-driven regime assignment
  - Four distinct colors: black (untrainable), red (optimally-sized), green (beneficial-regularization), blue (chaotic-optimization)
  - Uniform circle sizes with increased label offsets for clarity
  - Copies advanced labeling system from Parameter Matching heatmap

#### Classification Rules
- **Rule 1 (Untrainable)**: No mode exceeds 11.35% accuracy (Vanishing Gradient Problem)
- **Rule 2 (Beneficial Regularization)**: Baselines consistent AND (ablations within baseline std OR meaningful overlap >0.01%)
- **Rule 3 (Optimally Sized)**: Ablation harms by >1 effective std OR (baseline max > ablative max AND ablative mean â‰¤ baseline mean)
- **Rule 4 (Chaotic Optimization)**: Ablative mean > baseline mean + 0.5% (fixed threshold for better sensitivity)

### Enhanced

#### Visualization Improvements
- **Baseline Performance Heatmap**: Added colorbar for baseline accuracy visualization
- **Winning Strategy Heatmap**: Updated `mode_colors` dictionary to assign distinct colors to all six ablation modes
- **Parameter Matching Heatmap**: Refined Bezier curve control points and circle radius calculations for logarithmic axes
- **Design Space Plot**: Modified plotting order so square architectures appear on top of non-square ones

#### Advanced Labeling System
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Bezier curves for non-overlapping architecture labels
- **Logarithmic Scaling**: Proper point-based sizing accounting for logarithmic axes
- **Three Label Categories**: 
  - Shallow-and-wide: Curved labels above points
  - Square: Straight offset labels to the right
  - Deep-and-narrow: Curved labels below points

#### Data Processing
- **Six Ablation Modes**: Updated trial data parsing to handle all six modes (none, decay, dropout, full, hidden, output)
- **Enhanced Metrics**: Comprehensive statistics calculation for all modes
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing data and parsing errors

### Changed

#### Regime Classification Methodology
- **From Heuristic to Data-Driven**: Replaced parameter-count-based heuristics with performance-pattern analysis
- **Refined Thresholds**: 
  - Fixed 0.5% threshold for chaotic detection (more sensitive than variable std)
  - 0.01% overlap threshold for beneficial regularization
  - 0.1% difference threshold for optimally-sized classification
- **Max-Based Rules**: Added rules comparing best baseline vs best ablative performance

#### Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Added dataset analysis and regime classification sections
- **TOOLS.md**: Comprehensive documentation for new tools and enhanced features
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Created detailed changelog for tracking all changes

#### Poetry Configuration
- **New Script**: Added `analyze-dataset = "analyze_dataset:main"` to `pyproject.toml`
- **Dependencies**: Added `shapely = "<2.0"` for geometric operations (later removed when regimes visualization was simplified)

### Technical Details

#### Key Insights from Analysis
- **ZeroR Correspondence**: 11.35% untrainable threshold aligns with test set ZeroR baseline
- **Class 1 Dominance**: Most frequent class across all MNIST splits
- **Regime Distribution**: Final classification achieves:
  - Beneficial Regularization: 13 architectures (13%)
  - Optimally Sized: 23 architectures (23%)
  - Untrainable: 45 architectures (46%)
  - Chaotic Optimization: 17 architectures (17%)

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of matplotlib resources in all visualization scripts
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large datasets with robust error handling
- **Statistical Robustness**: Effective standard deviation capping prevents edge cases

#### Code Quality
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between data processing, classification, and visualization
- **Type Hints**: Comprehensive type annotations for better code maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages
- **Documentation**: Extensive docstrings and inline comments
